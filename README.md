Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: http://openmetaanalysis.github.io/checkpoint-inhibitors

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is or is not* effective. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I2 was '[moderate](http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm)' at XX%. This review updates the previously published meta-analysis.(1)

Meta-regression dooes not find modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) on the effect of the intervention.
